/* A multisig actor optimized for ease of use.
 * The user never has to pack their own calldata. Instead, use `easyPropose`.
 * This eliminates the need for UI support or helper contracts.
 *
 * To set up the multisig, specify the arguments, then add members
 *
 * First, call the multisig contract itself as if it were your target contract,
 * with the correct calldata. You can make Solidity and web3.js to do this for
 * you very easily by casting the multisig address as the target type.
 * Then, you call `easyPropose` with the missing arguments. This calls `propose`.
 *
 * "last calldata" is "local" to the `msg.sender`. This makes it usable directly
 * from keys (but still not as secure as if it were atomic using a helper contract).
 *
 * In Soldity:
 * 1) `TargetType(address(multisig)).doAction(arg1, arg2);`
 * 2) `multisig.easyPropose(address(target), value);`
 *
 * This is equivalent to `propose(address(my_target), <calldata>, value);`,
 * where calldata is correctly formatted for `TargetType(target).doAction(arg1, arg2)`
